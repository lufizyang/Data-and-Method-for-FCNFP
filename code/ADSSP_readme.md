 - The specific introduction about ADSSP algorithm refers to the paper: <font color=blue>Please wait... </font> 
 - File "ADSSP" contains the whole project about the algorithm's code in C++. I compile them on *Visual Studio 2022* and run a case in file "scale_6000_250000". 
 - The version of *Or-tools* in my experiments is <font color=blue> *9.2* </font>. The lib file is too large to push here. 
 - I reproduced the DSSP algorithm, which is contained in the project files. The DSSP process in ADSSP differs from the independent-running DSSP only in hyperparameters (such as the maximum number of iterations).
